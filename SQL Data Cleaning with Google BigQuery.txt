-- The Description column in the dataset appears to be a combination of multiple pieces of information (like service/product name, staff name, location, date, etc.).
-- Breaking down this single, compound column into distinct fields enables more granular analysis and easier querying in the future. It also improves data readability.
-- Furthermore, by integrating a CASE statement into the extraction process, there's also a simultaneous cleanup of service names. This results in standardized service names, making analysis more consistent.
-- Extract month and year from date columns to assist in seasonality detection.
-- Then joining this data to the original dataset by primary key that is created whilst also ensuring product and service names are consistent (no spelling errors or duplicates).
